title: The Job Hunt Begins
---

So here we are, about two weeks out of my graduation from Bloc.io and I am still looking for a job intently. We will see how it goes, but the common issue that I am running into is lack of experience. It is quite demoralizing to hear that every single job that I am looking for requires at least 3 - 5 years experience, and here I am with just over 4 months exerience. I'm still learning however, like how to make my limited experience look better than normal and finding some good references that can vouch for my technical experience. In the meantime while I'm job hunting, I am also learning some extra languages that I've wanted to learn. I've finally started fulling learning C++ for my gaming needs, and I'm starting to learn swift so that I could eventually get into iOS programming.

I'm staying busy, and I'm learning, but I really really want to just find a job somewhere where my talents can actualy be put to use. Cross your fingers for me; can't lose hope yet!!
