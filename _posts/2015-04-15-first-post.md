The beginning of a new idea, when you first start to realize that this might be the one. The feeling you get when you shoot up in bed, and just have to get to a computer to start working. That is why I’m writing this blog.

I, much like others, have many different ideas for games. But what I’ve found is that actually acting on those ideas; implementing them, play-testing them, and coding them – that right there is the most difficult thing to finish. I want to stop my bad behavior and talk about doing. I can tell you right now: I have the next great idea, but I just need to make it work.

I want to talk a little bit about how I got here, what made me start this process, and what it is like to be starting fresh. If you look into my “About” tab that I’ve put together, you can learn a little bit. I want to tell you the whole picture.

This story starts where any good gamer can guess. Christmas of 1996, “Santa” had gotten me a Nintendo 64. They had no idea how this would affect me. Sure I had a hand-me-down NES, a borrowed Super NES, but the 64… That was mine and mine alone. It changed a young 6 year-old boy. It opened up areas of imagination that I had never experienced before. I was avoiding enemy fire in Star Fox, saving the princess as Mario, and most importantly, traveling through time as a young speechless Link.

I connected with these characters, more than I could ever connect with any other person. I spent more and more time in front of the TV, stopped spending as much time hanging out with friends, and instead got new friends that I could live through. Of course as you can imagine, I was socially awkward as a child.

My good friends were the same like me: nerds that loved the virtual universes we created. I never really felt like a “nerd” though. I was experiencing worlds of wonder and magic, completely unlike the “normal” world. I thought we were at the top of fantasy immersion when I was in high school, doing things like defeating Sin as an emotional Tidus, saving the world from beings like the Flood and the Covenant, and then ruining the world as a terrible leader in a game of Civilization. Everything changed with a single game, however. It had been out for a couple months and people were talking about it like the next coming of the nerd; World of Warcraft.

This game was unlike any other that came before it in my mind. I created a warlock to start (was listening to a lot of Slayer at the time) and just loved the idea of controlling demons to my will. I fell in love instantly, and could not believe that this was a game. It was more in my mind, it was a living breathing world that I could lose myself in. I had that first moment of pure bliss, and I think that at that moment, I knew I would create more stories for the rest of my life.

This all, however, was not meant to be in the minds of my parents. I headed off to college three short years after the release of WoW. At that time, I was blessed enough to go completely funded by my parents. I was a smart kid, but I just didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. Up until this point I had been “good” at only a limited number of things: gaming, school, and music. Since gaming was out of the picture, I figured why not blend the other two?

In the end, I decided on Music Education. Not because I thought I wasn’t good enough to be a professional musician, but because I liked the idea of teaching. I could be my own boss (in a sense) and work directly with kids. I embraced this idea and dedicated myself to become the best teacher I could possibly be. I ended up getting both my Masters and Bachelors in Music Education, but during the entire process, I did not forget about my passion in life.

In college games started getting even more realistic and could tell even more capable stories. I now could save a world called Cocoon from Grand Pulse, I answered the Call of Duty with enumerable hours counted, and was introduced to the threat that was to be called the Reapers. But I always returned to my little World of Warcraft. I always returned to fight the legions of the Lich King and explore the burning Cataclysm. I was a master Warlock now, but I also found a beautiful Mage to begin accompanying me with my journey. Someone who impacted my life in such a major way that I could finally embrace who I really was. Not a teacher, but a gamer.

I began going to this Mage’s brother’s place every week to play a little game called Dungeons and Dragons. And at this moment I had found more bliss in life. I could do whatever I wanted to do in this created world. And what I wanted to do more than anything els was create my own. I began DM’ing for this group of friends and became quite good at it. I would spend all this time preparing and then they would break off of my path at the beginning of a game. This is where my teaching skills came into place; I would improvise entire game sessions. I vowed to never say no to what the group wanted to do.

After college, that little Mage became my wife. And I was doing many things; supporting my new family as a teacher, exploring writing code on my own time, and DM’ing every week (now barely preparing anything, but improving on the fly). I found quickly that something was wrong with my life, though. I would wake up every morning and read about games. I would teach during the day, then would spend my prep periods learning about Java and C++. I would go home and work on developing a board game that I thought of from scratch. Every single moment outside of my teaching commitments was dedicated to gaming. I decided; if I am going to be spending all of my free time on game, why not work on games?

And here we are today. The end of this school year will be my last as a full-time teacher. I began an online bootcamp at bloc.io to get significantly better at writing code. And I started this blog a month after. I am going to change my life and it will turn into doing something that I love from the bottom of my heart.

Wish me luck.
