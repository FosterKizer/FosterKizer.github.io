title: Review of Bloc.io
---

In my last post I talked a lot about how I got to where I’m at now, and I wanted to give a little insight to anyone considering going the coding bootcamp route. An in-depth analysis will follow; but overall I am pleased with Bloc.

Bloc.io, for anyone who doesn’t know, is an online focused coding bootcamp. The course offers three different timetables to complete their course (12 week, 16 week, 32 week), and has many different course paths for whatever you are interested in pursuing. As a perspective game developer I was interested the most in object-oriented programming as a starting point, so I went with the Full-Stack Web Development course on a 16 week timeline.

The course was structured into 2 major sections; a foundation section, and a project section. As of yesterday, I finished the foundation section and am moving onto the project section. What I enjoy the most about Bloc is that each lesson in broken into checkpoints. Each checkpoint potentially takes around 2 hours to complete, with 53 checkpoints total in the foundation. Yes some checkpoints took significantly longer to complete, but others were a breeze to finish. I found that as long as I vowed to complete around 2 checkpoints a day, I would do great.

The great thing about Bloc, is that you are not alone on this venture of learning how to code. At the beginning of your course, you choose a mentor that you will be working with. With my timetable of 16 week completion, I have dedicated two 30-minute long meetings a week to go over my code with my mentor and get any feedback on how to do something better. This mentor is great to have and they normally can get back to you within the hour if you are stuck on a particular line of code.

The foundation section was broken into 3 different sub-sections in my mind. The first was the basics behind ruby syntax and coding logic. What is a for loop, an array, or a hash are the types of things you learn about here. The second section sets up your environment on your computer. I highly recommend getting Ubuntu to start if you are a Windows person. Everything is so much easier to understand when you are working with a command line. In fact Bloc will not make sense until you get a version of Linux running on your comp. The third and longest section of the foundation is a step-by-step creation of a reddit clone webapp. This was a huge undertaking for me to complete, but I am glad I had the challenge of creating something like that.

Overall I want to list some different pros and cons I’ve come across with Bloc.

Pros:

* Dedicated mentor
* Clear lessons
* Logical progression of subjects
* Effective self-progress roadmap
* Multitude of resources to self-teach
* Mentor reviews all of your work

Cons:

* Almost too ‘self-taught’ at points
* Assignments at the end of lessons would often ask you to do things not covered in the checkpoint
* Constant refactoring of code within lesson
* If stuck, waiting a day for your mentor to get back to you can suck
* Overall price of the course
 

In the end, if you are planning on taking the leap into coding like myself; Bloc is a great tool if you have the drive to complete it. I would recommend this site to my friends, and any colleagues that I encounter in the world of game development.
