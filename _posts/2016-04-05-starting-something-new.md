title: Starting Something New
---

So here we are restarting this blog almost a year after the first post went live. I've gone through a major change working for some tech firms over the course of this year, but I've started out on my own. I would like to proudly announce the creation of my own company **K.Bit Games**. 

I am going to be focusing on the creation of mobile games and I want to have a weekly dev blog featured here on this site. A couple of days after the release of this post, I am going to be going over the various trials and innerworkings of what it takes to create your own game from scratch. I can give some details before the next post however; I've done considerable work creating a prototype of the game I want to create and this first post will go over the thought process of creating a game.

The first and most important stage of development is prototyping. One good analogy for game design I’ve heard is this; imagine your game that you want to create is a cake. On the outside of your cake you have frosting, decorations, and maybe layers that showcase how awesome your cake is. In game design these are the features of your game, the art, and the music. But inside your cake is the filling, the most important part because you can taste it when you actually cut into the cake. In Game Design this is the core “Loop” of your game.

The “Loop” of a game is the core most basic staple of the game and the structure you base everything else on. In an RTS like *Starcraft 2*, the “Loop” is selecting units, moving them, and attacking other units. In a shooter like the famous *Call of Duty* franchise, the “Loop” is move, shoot, and then reward. If these core aspects of your game are not fun then it is not worth pursuing a project. No matter how many hours you put into the art, the multiplayer, or even the level design; it is not going to matter if your core “Loop” sucks.

This is what I have done for my first game. I have created a match 3 style game in the same style of *You Must Build A Boat*. For those who haven’t played this game, when you select an object to move to try and match three in a row, you move the entire row of objects instead of simply switching the object with the object next to it like popular games *Candy Crush* or *Bejeweled*.

In my next post we will be going over how I created this prototype, why I decided on the engine that I am using for the game, and the next steps I need to be considering for the game. For those of you who are interested in following the development of this game, you can tune into my [personal website](../../../).
