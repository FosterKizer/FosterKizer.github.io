I am proud to annouce that I have gotten far enough into the development into this game that I feel comfortable publishing an early build of the game. If you are using Chrome, you won't be able to play the game, so simply switch to using IE or Firefox.

A bit about the game since a tutorial is not built in yet; it is a simple match 3 style game. Move rows and columns by simply selecting a tile and moving your mouse. Your goal is to try and match 3 of one type of tile in a row. There are poison tiles that cannot be matched this way, simply double click a poison tile and it will remove all poison tiles touching it at a cost of points. The large green bar at the top center is your health, a monster is attacking you and it is your goal to last as long as possible. If you match health packs together your health will go up a small amount. Also, if you manage to match 5 tile in a row, it will create a special tile. Match it again for a unique animation.

There are a number of bugs in this game at this stage, so be expected to have some confusing things happen. Share and like this on Facebook and Twitter. I'll have a more in-depth overview about the mechanics of the game done this weekend. I look forward to hearing your feedback!
