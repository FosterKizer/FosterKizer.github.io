## Explanation

This was my very first project created with Bloc.io. At this point I knew very little about ruby or rails, and was jumping into the deep end as you will. I created this site with a lot of help , going step by step through a process directed by Bloc.io. This project was created with help from my mentor Felix Clack.

## Problem

The problem that I wanted to remedy from creating this site was not knowing how to code. I needed an introduction into Ruby and Rails and this site was the portal that would become my jump into the coding world.

## Solution

This site was created using a step by step guide that was created by Bloc.io. I learned things from models and controllers, to AJAX and CRUD. This would be the best route to achieve some of my own personal goals.

## Results

I can tell you that from doing this site, I learned a lot about errors and how to read them. I dealt with a multitude of issues like forgetting an end, or a ) inside a line of code. I did not let it break me, and I can say that I have created a number of different sites because of the learning that I recieved through this creation.

## Conclusion

I would say that creating this site was a great success. However, after looking back at a creation that I completed some 2.5 months ago in the early stages of my education, I just want to go through and refactor so much of the code. I have so many skills that I have learned past this point that I  want to adapt to this original site.
