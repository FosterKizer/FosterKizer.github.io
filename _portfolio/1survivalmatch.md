### Description
Survive as long as you can on a planet infested with deadly creatures. Match icons to attack, defend, and heal yourself against a variety of different monsters. Level up to combat the more difficult entities you encounter. Each time you play is different!

### Hurdles
Coding this game had its own issues, but I felt that overall it came together very nicely. If I had to be critical; I would say there were three major areas that I could have improved on significantly.

1. Be more diligent with creating artwork. Be proud of what you create and focus more to create assets faster.
2. Figure out the issues with tiles disappearing in the game. It is never good to publish a game with a known bug in it.
3. Be more open to sharing the work put into a game. The only way to improve aspects of the game, is to get it in other's hands.

If I could improve these three areas. The next game I create will be much more successful, and I will be happier overall during the development process.

### Personal Progress
In creating this game I learned a lot about myself and my capabilities. I also learned a number of great skills that can carry over to future projects. If I had to pick out one thing I learned the most while creating this game; I would have to say it would be Lists. For the unaware; Lists are very similar in coding to Arrays. An Array is group of variables (either a string, int, bool, etc) that have a set number of components. For instance, I could have an array of 10 integers, and I would have to declare that there would be 10 components when creating the Array. Lists on the other hand, can store more complex variables, and you do not have to declare the number of components before creating the List. So if I did not know exactly how many elements would become destroyed, I could create a List to be able to hold those variables.
