## Explanation

This project was born as my first project that I completed without strict handholding from Bloc.io. I worked on this project for 3 weeks as a goal to improve my overall coding ability, and to learn what it was like to produce a real web application without constant aid. I worked on this site primaraly with my mentor Felix Clack at Bloc.io.

## Problem

Everyone uses to-do lists. The issue that arises out of a personal to-do list is that we put things off and we say that it will get done "tomorrow". We tend to think that it will get done at some point, but deep down we know better.

## Solution

This application hopes to remedy some of those issues by self-destructing to-do items that are a week old. The philosophy is that you should do it within a week, and if you don't you probably will never get around to it. This makes users more accountable for their to-do items, and forces them to think of completing things that are going to be destroyed soon.

## Results

As this application was a project to improve coding ability and learning. I have not had any chance to put the application in the hands of users that use it consistantly. Results at the moment are based completely on personal use. I find that using the Blocitoff utility did want me to complete tasks before a week was over.

## Conclusion

Overall with this project I learned a lot about Ruby and Rails. I learned how to think of object more clearly, and how to implement different types of ideas into a practical use.
