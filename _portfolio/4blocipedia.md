### Description
A public wiki site made to use markdown for the individual wikis. Also if the user pays for premium service, they can create private wikis and can invite non-paying users to edit and view them.

### Hurdles
The largest issue with this site that I had to overcome is the privatization of wikis. I spent a very long time working on how a user can pay for the premium service and how they could invite users to edit their private wikis. It was a very difficult experience, but through perseverance the site is now finished and functional.

### Personal Progress
With the creation of this site, I wanted to try and use a different CSS suite than what I was used to. This enabled me to be flexible and learn the differences between different suites and what each suite requires to use it correctly. I absolutely enjoyed working on this project.
