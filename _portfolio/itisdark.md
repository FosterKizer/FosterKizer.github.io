### Description
It Is Dark... You wake up in a clearing with no memory of what has happened. Try to survive against creatures in the wilderness, hunger, and the dark unknown.

Created in 48 hours as part of Ludum Dare Game Jam 36.

### Hurdles
As a project that is still a work in progress, I can go into detail about some of the hurdles that I had to do to complete it. As this project was part of a game jam, there was a massive pressure on time limit in completing it. I was constantly aware of the clock ticking down, and so I had to make quick decisions so I would complete it in time.

1. Don't re-invent the wheel. Know what you do best in a quick fashion, and do it.
2. Have a solid foundation to build on for after the game jam.
3. Create goals that were achievable, and prepare for it all to go wrong.
4. Have a blast working on it.

### Personal Progress
For me, just the fact that I created a game in 48 hours was enough. But it was really amazing using the skills I have learned creating Survival Match, and using them in this project. I went all out using Lists, creating a text writer, and setting up a content web. It was a really fun project and I plan on continuing it in the future.

### Future Plans
As of now, the game can be completed in 5 - 10 minutes. I want to create more content so that it could take upwards of 2 hours, and then release the entire game on iPhone. I am expecting this to be done in about a month or two.
