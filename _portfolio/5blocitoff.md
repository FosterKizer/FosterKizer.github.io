### Description
A self-destructing to-do list created using Ruby on Rails. With this web app; you can create to-do items for yourself to follow. However, if after 7 day you do not complete the item. The application will automatically delete it. The hope is for the user to continuously be working at finishing items so that nothing gets automatically deleted.

### Hurdles
This was my second project I have ever done, and I finished this one considerably quicker than the first. The main issues that I had on this project dealt with being more solo oriented than the first project. I didn't have a mentor to help me out as much while I completed this site. So I was forced to use methods that were not future-proof, or that did not make much sense.

### Personal Progress
With this project I feel that I learned a lot of skills in the area of self-sufficiency and learning the answer on my own. I was forced to think more outside the box and use a lot of critical thinking to find the correct answer to an issue that would arise. For instance, I spent quite a lot of time on figuring out how to have items automatically delete. So I was forced to use every resource I had available to find the answer.
