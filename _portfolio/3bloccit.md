### Description
Bloccit is my very first website created using Ruby on Rails. It is a clone of popular social media site Reddit. It allows users to create posts, assign them to topics, and comment on other user's posts. There is a voting mechanic so that more popular posts get higher visibility, and there are personal profiles that each user can sign in to.

### Hurdles
Being my first major project that I finished to completion; this project had a number of hurdles in just figuring out how systems worked, and how to finish objectives in a timely manner. I had a lot of help from a mentor that pointed me in the right direction, but a lot of things too far too much time since I was quite new to the idea of webpage design. I would say that throughout the process of creating this site, I learned a profound amount about collaboration and talking things through with others to figure out a solution.

### Personal Progress
As my first project, I saw the most progress in this project than any other project I've worked on. I learned concepts from; how a user can delete a public post, how to format the backend of a website to allow large amounts of data storage, and how to create websites using the Rails framework.
