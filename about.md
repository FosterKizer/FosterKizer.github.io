My name is Foster Kizer, and I'm beginning the journey that is Game and Software Development. I am 25 years old based out of Eugene, OR. Before starting this journey, I completed a Bachelor's and Master's in Music Education at the University of Oregon. You can say that my goals are quite different from where I've started. Obviously this switch from teaching to programming is a drastic change in thought, and I am taking it completely in stride so I can better think and act like a programmer.

My goal by doing this blog is to be able to design or program at a level that I could be employed by a company that could see my skill for what they are, hard work and dedication. I want to work somewhere that does not just look at a piece of paper to determine who you are, but looks at your background and contacts you with questions that arise. I can prove to anyone that I am passionate about what I do, and am excited to get going on this extreamly cool adventure that is programming and development.
